# Character Recognition Project Charter

Character recognition project for the course MSiA423: Analytics Value Chain

## Project Charter

Predict the character drawn by the user on the web app by using a neural network model based on the grayscale pixel values of the image to assist in building a handwriting input keyboard system that can be employed on different smartphones.

### Vision 

Assist in building a handwriting input keyboard system that can be employed on different smartphones.

### Mission 

Predict the character drawn by the user on the web app by using a neural network model based on the grayscale pixel values of the image.

### Success criteria 

Accuracy of classification for the neural network on a pre-determined test set of grayscale character images.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

### Setting up your Virtual Environment

Create a new virtual environment

```
virtualenv -p python3 CharRecognizer
source CharRecognizer/bin/activate
```

Install requirements

```
pip install -r develop/requirements.txt
```
