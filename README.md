# Character Recognizer

Predict the character drawn by the user on the web app by using a neural network model based on the grayscale pixel values of the image to assist in building a handwriting input keyboard system that can be employed on different smartphones.

### Vision

Assist in building a handwriting input keyboard system that can be employed on different smartphones.

### Mission

Predict the character drawn by the user on the web app by using a neural network model based on the grayscale pixel values of the image.

### Success criteria

Accuracy of classification for the neural network on a pre-determined test set of grayscale character images.

### Dependencies

Successfully running the code requires:

- Python (>= 3.4)
- numpy (>= 1.13.1)
- pandas(>= 0.20.3)
- Keras (>= 2.1.3)
- scikit-learn==0.19.1

### Code
The code can be found in the jupyter notebook, [develop/recognizer.ipynb](develop/recognizer.ipynb)

*Development in progress.*
